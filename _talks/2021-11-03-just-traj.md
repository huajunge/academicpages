With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive trajectories have been generated. Trajectory data is beneficial for many urban applications. This demo presents a holistic trajectory data management system based on distributed platforms, such as Spark and HBase, namely JUST-Traj. It provides a variety of indexes to efficiently support spatio-temporal queries and analyses on massive trajectories. Additionally, it provides a convenient SQL engine to execute all operations (storage, queries, analyses) through a SQL-like statement. Finally, we design a web portal for developers and demonstrate different operations in the portal. [Demo Link](http://just-traj.urban-computing.com/)
