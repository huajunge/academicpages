Virus transmission from person to person is an emergency event facing the global public. Early detection and isolation of potentially susceptible crowds can effectively control the epidemic of its disease. Existing metrics can not correctly address the infected rate on trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a novel spatio-temporal infected rate (IR) measure based on human moving trajectories that can adequately describe the risk of being infected by a given query trajectory of a patient. Then, we manage source data through an efficient spatio-temporal index to make our system more scalable, and can quickly query susceptible crowds from massive trajectories. Besides, we design several pruning strategies that can effectively reduce calculations. Further, we design a spatial first time (SFT) index, which enables us to quickly query multiple trajectories without much I/O consumption and data redundancy. The performance of
the solutions is demonstrated in experiments based on real and synthetic trajectory datasets that have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions.
